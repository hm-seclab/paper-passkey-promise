# The Passkey Promise: A Comparative Usability Study of MFA Methods

This repository accompanies the paper _The Passkey Promise: A Comparative Usability Study of MFA Methods_, accepted to the 47th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P 2026).

It provides supplementary material, including:
- An expanded [appendix](https://github.com/hm-seclab/paper-passkey-promise/blob/main/Detailed_Appendix.pdf) with replication materials, the detailed qualitative codebook, and screenshots of key interfaces.
- Visual [walkthroughs](https://github.com/hm-seclab/paper-passkey-promise/tree/main/walkthroughs) of our self-service UI, illustrating the main steps of enrollment and authentication flows.
- The full set of quantitative [scores](https://github.com/hm-seclab/paper-passkey-promise/blob/main/quantitative_scores.csv) from participants.
- Our detailed qualitative [codebook](https://github.com/hm-seclab/paper-passkey-promise/blob/main/qualitative_codes.xlsx), enriched with example quotes.

These materials are provided to support transparency and facilitate replication of our study.
